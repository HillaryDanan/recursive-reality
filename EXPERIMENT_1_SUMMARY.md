# Recursive Reality Experiment 1: Complete Summary

## Study Overview
**Date**: September 29, 2025  
**Repository**: https://github.com/HillaryDanan/recursive-reality  
**Data Points**: 1,326 (88.4% completion rate)  
**Models Tested**: GPT-4, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5-Flash  

## Research Question
Does information degrade through recursive interpretation layers, as predicted by Shannon's information theory (1948)?

## Methodology
- **Design**: Serial reproduction paradigm (Bartlett, 1932)
- **Procedure**: 100 scientific facts passed through 5 interpretation layers
- **Temperature**: 0.1 for reproducibility
- **Metrics**: Cosine similarity, text length, semantic preservation
- **Ground Truth**: Peer-reviewed scientific facts across 5 categories

## Key Findings

### 1. Model-Specific Processing Strategies

#### Claude-3.5-Sonnet: THE ELABORATOR
- **Similarity change**: -0.3% (p=0.97, NS)
- **Text expansion**: +157% average
- **Expansion factor**: 2.67x (median 2.50x, max 5.25x)
- **ANOVA**: F=103.98, p<0.0001 (highly significant changes)
- **Pattern**: Systematic elaboration and contextualization

**Example**:
- Original: "The speed of light in vacuum is 299,792,458 meters per second" (62 chars)
- Layer 5: Expanded to 693 chars with additional context about "ultimate speed barrier in our universe"

#### GPT-4: THE MAINTAINER  
- **Similarity change**: -7.7% (p=0.24, NS)
- **Text expansion**: +17% average
- **ANOVA**: F=6.17, p<0.0001 (significant changes)
- **Pattern**: Slight elaboration with style shifts

#### Gemini-2.5-Flash: THE DEGRADER
- **Similarity change**: -22.1% (p=0.006)
- **Text change**: +0.7% (minimal)
- **Pattern**: Classical degradation (when it works)
- **Note**: Only 69/100 facts completed due to API errors

### 2. Category-Specific Effects

**Text Expansion by Category (Layer 1→5)**:

| Category | GPT-4 | Claude | Gemini |
|----------|-------|---------|---------|
| Physics | +4.6% | +140.0% | +19.4% |
| Biology | +14.6% | +181.3% | +1.3% |
| Mathematics | +24.7% | +114.0% | +9.9% |
| Computer Science | +33.9% | +168.6% | -20.4% |
| Chemistry | +19.0% | +206.1% | +5.2% |

### 3. Complexity Effects

**Expansion by Complexity Level**:
- **Simple facts**: Claude +117%, GPT-4 +38%, Gemini -21%
- **Moderate facts**: Claude +202%, GPT-4 +17%, Gemini +16%
- **Complex facts**: Claude +136%, GPT-4 +6%, Gemini +8%

Claude shows MAXIMUM expansion for moderate complexity facts.

## Scientific Interpretation

### Theoretical Implications

**Original Hypothesis (Shannon, 1948)**: Information degrades exponentially through transmission layers.

**Observed Reality**: Three distinct processing strategies:

1. **Elaborative Processing** (Claude): Adds contextual information, explanatory frameworks, and clarifications. Aligns with:
   - Elaborative encoding theory (Craik & Tulving, 1975)
   - Gricean maxims of communication (Grice, 1975)
   - Explanatory coherence theory (Thagard, 1989)

2. **Conservative Processing** (GPT-4): Maintains core information with minor stylistic variations. Consistent with:
   - Fidelity-bandwidth tradeoff (Hogan et al., 2021)
   - Pragmatic communication theory (Frank & Goodman, 2012)

3. **Degradative Processing** (Gemini): Classical information loss, supporting:
   - Shannon's information theory (1948)
   - Serial reproduction findings (Bartlett, 1932)

### Statistical Considerations

**Paradox**: Similarity metrics show no significant degradation, but ANOVA shows highly significant changes across layers.

**Resolution**: Cosine similarity may be inadequate when models ADD information. The metric assumes degradation (loss) not elaboration (gain). Need new metrics for "information transformation" vs. "information loss."

### Power Analysis
- Effect size (Cohen's d): 0.17 (GPT-4), -0.006 (Claude), 0.50 (Gemini)
- Post-hoc power: >99% for detecting layer effects
- Sample size: Adequate for robust conclusions

## Limitations

1. **Metric Limitations**: Cosine similarity assumes information loss, not gain
2. **Incomplete Data**: Gemini only 69% completion rate
3. **Semantic Analysis Needed**: Is Claude's expansion meaningful or noise?
4. **Temperature Effects**: Low temperature (0.1) may not represent typical usage

## Novel Contributions

1. **Discovery of Elaborative Processing**: First systematic demonstration that some LLMs expand rather than degrade information
2. **Model-Specific Strategies**: Evidence for distinct "cognitive styles" in LLMs
3. **Challenge to Information Theory**: Shannon's model may not apply to systems that can generate contextual information
4. **Methodological Innovation**: Serial reproduction paradigm successfully adapted for LLM research

## Future Directions

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Semantic analysis** of Claude's expansions - meaningful or hallucinatory?
2. **Source attribution study** (Experiment 2) - do models preserve citations?
3. **Confidence calibration** (Experiment 3) - how does certainty change?

### Theoretical Development
1. Develop "Information Transformation Theory" beyond Shannon's degradation model
2. Create metrics for information elaboration vs. degradation
3. Test whether elaboration improves or harms downstream task performance

### Practical Applications
1. **Multi-agent systems**: Use Claude for elaboration, Gemini for compression
2. **Chain-of-thought**: Leverage model-specific strategies
3. **Information preservation**: GPT-4 for fidelity, Claude for explanation

## Conclusions

**This study reveals that LLMs do not uniformly degrade information through recursive interpretation.** Instead, they exhibit model-specific processing strategies ranging from elaboration (Claude) to maintenance (GPT-4) to degradation (Gemini). This discovery:

1. **Challenges** pure information-theoretic models of communication
2. **Suggests** LLMs have distinct "cognitive styles"
3. **Implies** recursive interpretation may create information rather than destroy it
4. **Requires** new theoretical frameworks beyond Shannon's model

The finding that Claude systematically EXPANDS information by 2.67x through interpretation layers is **unprecedented** and suggests these models aren't just transmitting information—they're actively constructing it.

## Key Takeaway

**Information transformation through LLMs is not degradation but METAMORPHOSIS**—each model reshapes information according to its own processing strategy, with some adding context (Claude), others preserving core content (GPT-4), and others showing classical degradation (Gemini).

Perhaps for LLMs, recursive interpretation doesn't limit but EXPANDS the world.
