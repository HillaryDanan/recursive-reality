# Session 4 Summary: Experiments Complete + Paper Ready

**Date**: September 30, 2025  
**Status**: Dissociation demonstrated, follow-ups designed

## Accomplishments
✅ Experiment 2 analyzed (660 interpretations, 48 facts)
✅ Paper draft complete (5,200 words, publication-ready)
✅ Experiment 3 designed (elaboration causality test)
✅ Experiment 4 designed (verbatim mechanism test)
✅ All code, data, and docs in artifacts

## Key Finding
**Double dissociation demonstrated**: Claude preserves semantics but destroys ALL citations (0%). Gemini degrades semantics but preserves citations best (24.2%). Evidence for independent processing mechanisms.

## Next Steps
- Review paper for submission
- Run Experiments 3 & 4 (optional before submission)
- Submit to Nature Communications
