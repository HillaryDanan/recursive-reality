# Recursive Reality

## Research Question

How does increasing reliance on digitally-mediated information affect human epistemic practices and reality perception? This repository explores the hypothesis that consuming multiple layers of human interpretation rather than direct empirical observation may alter how people construct models of reality.

## Current Status

### Pilot Experiment Complete (September 29, 2025)

We have completed initial pilot testing of information transformation through recursive interpretation using Large Language Models (LLMs) as experimental systems. Preliminary findings suggest model-specific processing strategies that diverge from predictions based on Shannon's information theory (1948).

## Theoretical Framework

**Traditional Empirical Process**
```
Physical Reality â†’ Direct Observation â†’ Hypothesis â†’ Testing â†’ Knowledge
```

**Digital Information Flow**
```
Physical Reality â†’ Observer's Interpretation â†’ Media Framing â†’ Social Distribution â†’ Individual Reception
```

We hypothesize that each interpretive layer may introduce transformations, with effects varying by processing system. Initial pilot data suggests these transformations may involve both information loss and information generation.

## Preliminary Findings

### Experiment 1: Information Transformation Through Layers (Pilot Phase)

**Method**: 100 scientific facts passed through 5 interpretation layers using three LLMs (GPT-4, Claude-3.5, Gemini-2.5)

**Initial Observations**:
- Models exhibit distinct processing strategies rather than uniform degradation
- Some systems appear to elaborate information while others compress it
- Effects vary by content category and complexity

**Data Available**: 
- Pilot dataset: 1,326 data points (88.4% completion)
- Analysis scripts and visualizations in `/experiments/exp1_degradation/`

*Note: These are preliminary findings from pilot testing. Full experimental validation and peer review are required before drawing definitive conclusions.*

## Research Program

### Completed
- âœ… Experiment 1 pilot: Serial reproduction through interpretation layers
- âœ… Ground truth dataset: 100 scientific facts with peer-reviewed sources
- âœ… Statistical framework and power analysis

### In Progress
- ðŸ”„ Semantic analysis of transformation patterns
- ðŸ”„ Validation of pilot findings with expanded sample

### Planned Experiments

#### Experiment 2: Source Attribution Preservation
- Research question: How does source attribution degrade through interpretation layers?
- Hypothesis: Attribution accuracy decreases with each layer (Johnson & Raye, 1981)
- Method: Track citation preservation through recursive processing

#### Experiment 3: Confidence Calibration
- Research question: How does confidence calibration change through mediated information?
- Hypothesis: Overconfidence increases with interpretation distance (Lichtenstein et al., 1982)
- Method: Force confidence ratings at each interpretation layer

#### Experiment 4: Semantic Coherence Analysis
- Research question: When information expands through interpretation, is meaning preserved or distorted?
- Hypothesis: Elaboration may introduce semantic drift (Bartlett, 1932)
- Method: Deep semantic analysis of expansions vs. original content

## Methodological Approach

### Design Principles
- Serial reproduction paradigm (Bartlett, 1932)
- Controlled temperature settings (0.1) for reproducibility
- Multiple similarity metrics for robustness
- Stratified sampling across complexity levels
- Pre-registered hypotheses before data collection

### Statistical Framework
- Power analysis targeting 80% at Î±=0.05
- Effect size calculations (Cohen's d)
- Mixed-effects models for nested data
- Multiple comparison corrections where appropriate
