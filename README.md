# Recursive Reality

## Research Question

How does increasing reliance on digitally-mediated information affect human epistemic practices and reality perception? This repository explores the hypothesis that consuming multiple layers of human interpretation rather than direct empirical observation may alter how people construct models of reality.

## Theoretical Framework

**Traditional Empirical Process**
```
Physical Reality → Direct Observation → Hypothesis → Testing → Knowledge
```

**Digital Information Flow**
```
Physical Reality → Observer's Interpretation → Media Framing → Social Distribution → Individual Reception
```

We hypothesize that each interpretive layer may introduce distortions, remove context, and amplify certain biases. This project investigates whether and how these cumulative effects influence belief formation and reality perception.

## Research Motivation

The scientific method emphasizes testing hypotheses against empirical observation (Popper, 1959). Digital media introduces a condition where much information comes pre-interpreted through multiple human filters. This repository examines:

- To what extent digital mediation affects source monitoring and reality perception
- Whether recursive interpretation creates measurable distortions in understanding
- How these effects might manifest in both human cognition and AI systems

## Proposed Research Program

### 1. Human Cognition Studies
Investigating how digital media consumption correlates with:
- Source monitoring accuracy (distinguishing primary from secondary sources)
- Confidence calibration about mediated vs. direct information
- Susceptibility to consensus effects

### 2. AI Model Systems
Using Large Language Models as controlled experimental systems to study:
- How training data composition (primary sources vs. interpretations) affects output accuracy
- Whether models exhibit predictable biases based on interpretation layers
- Potential methods for detecting and correcting recursive distortions

### 3. Empirical Measurement
Developing metrics to quantify:
- Information degradation through sequential interpretation
- The relationship between digital media exposure and empirical reasoning
- Effectiveness of interventions to maintain epistemic grounding

## Current Status

This project is in the theoretical development stage. We are:
- Reviewing existing literature on source monitoring, information cascades, and digital epistemology
- Designing pilot experiments using publicly available LLMs
- Developing hypotheses for empirical testing

## Key Research Questions

- How do people weight digitally-mediated information versus direct experience when forming beliefs?
- Can we quantify information degradation through layers of interpretation?
- Do AI systems trained on human-generated content exhibit recursive biases?
- What interventions might help maintain empirical grounding in digital contexts?

- `/protocols`: Experimental designs (forthcoming)
- `/analysis`: Analysis scripts (forthcoming)
- `/results`: Findings (forthcoming)

## Contributing

We welcome collaboration from researchers interested in:
- Digital epistemology and information theory
- Cognitive psychology of source monitoring
- AI interpretability and training data effects
- Mathematical models of information transmission

## Limitations and Scope

This research:
- Does not claim digital media entirely replaces direct experience
- Acknowledges benefits of digital information access
- Focuses on understanding rather than prescribing behavior
- Requires empirical validation of theoretical proposals
