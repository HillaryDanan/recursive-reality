# Recursive Reality: A Theoretical Framework for Understanding Digital Mediation Effects on Epistemic Practices

## Abstract

Digital media has increased human reliance on mediated information relative to direct sensory experience. We propose a theoretical framework suggesting that consuming information through multiple layers of human interpretation may create recursive loops that alter epistemic practices. While the full effects remain to be empirically established, preliminary evidence suggests digital mediation may influence source monitoring, reality perception, and belief formation. We propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) as controlled experimental systems to study these potential effects. This paper presents testable hypotheses while acknowledging the complex interplay between digital and direct experience in contemporary life.

## Introduction

Human knowledge acquisition involves both direct sensory experience and social learning (Henrich, 2015). The scientific method formalized systematic empirical testing as a means of validating beliefs against physical reality (Popper, 1959). Digital media introduces a contemporary condition where an increasing proportion of information arrives pre-interpreted through multiple human filters, though direct experience remains important in many contexts.

This paper explores the hypothesis that heavy reliance on multiply-mediated information may influence epistemic practices. We do not claim digital media entirely replaces direct experience, but rather examine how the balance between mediated and direct information sources may affect cognition. We propose LLMs as model systems for controlled investigation of these dynamics.

## Part I: LLMs as Experimental Systems

### Rationale for LLM Studies

Large Language Models offer controlled conditions for studying information mediation effects:

1. **Documented Training Data**: Researchers can analyze the composition and sources of training corpora (Bommasani et al., 2021)

2. **Measurable Outputs**: Systematic analysis of model responses allows quantification of potential biases and accuracy (Wang et al., 2023)

3. **Variable Training Conditions**: Models can be trained on different ratios of primary to interpreted sources

### Proposed Experimental Framework

#### Research Question
Do LLMs exhibit measurable differences in factual accuracy and interpretation patterns based on the proportion of primary versus mediated sources in training data?

#### Hypothetical Study Design

**Dataset Categories:**
- Primary Sources: Peer-reviewed research, direct measurement data, government statistics
- Secondary Sources: News articles summarizing research, educational materials
- Tertiary Sources: Social media discussions, opinion pieces about news

**Proposed Measurements:**

1. **Factual Accuracy**: Compare outputs against established ground truth
2. **Source Attribution**: Analyze whether models correctly identify information origins
3. **Uncertainty Expression**: Measure calibration of confidence for claims at different mediation levels

#### Predicted Patterns

Based on information theory (Shannon, 1948), we hypothesize potential degradation patterns, though empirical testing is required:

- Accuracy may decrease with interpretation layers
- Confidence calibration may worsen for highly mediated information
- Consensus effects may be amplified in tertiary source training

These remain hypotheses requiring validation through controlled experiments.

## Part II: Human Cognitive Considerations

### Theoretical Background

#### Established Findings

1. **Source Monitoring**: Humans can struggle to distinguish information sources, particularly in digital contexts (Johnson & Raye, 1981; Marsh & Yang, 2017)

2. **Information Cascades**: People sometimes override personal judgment when perceiving group consensus (Bikhchandani et al., 1992)

3. **Digital Echo Chambers**: Algorithm-driven content curation can create filter bubbles (Cinelli et al., 2021)

#### Proposed Extensions

We hypothesize that heavy reliance on mediated information may:

- Reduce practice with direct empirical reasoning
- Increase difficulty distinguishing primary from interpreted sources
- Potentially alter confidence calibration about indirect knowledge

These hypotheses require longitudinal studies to establish causality.

### The Role of Direct Experience

Physical interaction provides feedback mechanisms that purely digital information may lack:

- **Embodied Cognition**: Sensorimotor experience grounds abstract concepts (Barsalou, 2008)
- **Prediction Error Signals**: Direct experience generates immediate corrective feedback (Clark, 2013)
- **Multimodal Verification**: Physical reality engages multiple senses simultaneously (Ernst & Banks, 2002)

We propose studying how varying ratios of digital to direct experience correlate with epistemic practices, while acknowledging individual variation and context-dependency.

## Hypothesized Mechanisms

### Mechanism 1: Information Degradation

Serial transmission of information typically involves some loss of fidelity (Shannon, 1948). Applied to digital media:

**Hypothesis**: Information accuracy may decrease with each interpretive layer, potentially following a degradation function

This requires empirical measurement across different information types and contexts.

### Mechanism 2: Algorithmic Curation Effects

Recommendation algorithms optimize for engagement, which may correlate with confirmation bias (Cinelli et al., 2021). This could create feedback loops, though the strength and universality of these effects remains under investigation.

### Mechanism 3: Scale Effects on Social Proof

Social proof mechanisms evolved in small groups (Boyd & Richerson, 1985). Digital platforms operate at unprecedented scales, potentially altering these dynamics, though empirical evidence for specific effects is still developing.

## Testable Predictions

This framework generates empirically testable hypotheses:

1. **Individuals with higher digital media consumption may show differences in source monitoring accuracy**
2. **Training data composition may correlate with LLM output patterns**
3. **Explicit source-checking training might mitigate potential mediation effects**

These predictions require careful experimental design to control for confounding variables.

## Discussion

### Potential Implications

If empirically validated, these mechanisms might influence:

- Educational approaches to digital literacy
- AI training data curation strategies
- Design of information systems to preserve source transparency

### Important Caveats

- Digital media also provides unprecedented access to information and diverse perspectives
- Many individuals successfully navigate both digital and direct information sources
- Individual differences likely play a significant role in susceptibility to any effects
- The relationship between digital consumption and epistemic practices is likely complex and bidirectional

### Working Hypotheses for Future Research

**LLM Studies**: We propose that comparing models trained on different source types may reveal how mediation affects information processing. This remains a hypothesis requiring empirical validation.

**Human Studies**: Longitudinal research could examine whether changes in media consumption patterns correlate with epistemic practices, while controlling for confounding factors.

## Limitations

- Causal claims require longitudinal and experimental validation
- LLMs may not accurately model human cognition
- Cultural and individual variations likely moderate any effects
- Benefits of digital information access must be weighed against potential costs

## Conclusion

This theoretical framework proposes that increasing reliance on multiply-mediated digital information may influence epistemic practices, though the magnitude and universality of effects remains to be established. LLMs offer a promising experimental system for controlled studies. Understanding these dynamics—if empirically validated—could inform approaches to digital literacy, AI development, and information system design.
